# MyPlace
Trying to redo

The software engineering project that we plan to work on is a command line tool that generates a pop-up display to save places that you have been to that you liked and places that you want to go to in the future. This application will allow for people to more easily save their travel recommendations and travel wishlist with a model more interactive and engaging than a traditional list.
